# Note Patterns
-> describe how a [[Notes|note]] has to be structured
- specified within a YAML file
- each [[Notes|note]] may only follow one pattern at a time

**Constituents:**
- the name of the pattern
- a [[Compound Note Pattern Elements|compound element]] or [[Constrained Note Pattern Elements|constrained element]] definition that describes the document structure that [[Notes|notes]] using this pattern have to follow
- optional: file name pattern and provided/linked value used for note identification

**YAML Structure:** TODO
